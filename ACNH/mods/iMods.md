You should probably know how to install mods by now, but if not:<br>
Extract the zip or 7z file you get after downloading, and merge the atmosphere folder from the zip to your Switch. You should NOT have two atmosphere folders (one inside the other).

# iHud

<img align="left" src="../../assets/images/NH/mods/i/simply-iHud.png" width="50%"></a> 
This mod completely hides the hud (map, phone, time and date). Great for screenshots and cinematic videos.<br>It's a small and simple BCSV edit.

## How does it work?

In PlayerStateParam.bcsv, the HideHud's (hash `5681a1c3`) functionality is to hide the hud when entering a certain state. Things like using a tool, moving furniture, and sitting down on stumps hide the hud by default.

This mod hides the hud in every state, so even when idling you don't see anything.<br>And if you're asking why not to use the camera, it doesn't follow you when you walk away, and it doesn't allow you to actually play the game with the HUD hidden.
