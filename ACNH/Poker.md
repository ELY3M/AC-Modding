# Poker

**Poker** is a live injector for New Horizons, allowing you to spawn (inject) items into your inventory, change your villagers, edit critter spawn rate, regenerate your island, and more. It was made by MyShiLingStar (myss) and is one of two live injectors currently available.

## Comparing Poker to the Mobile Spawner

A question that comes up a lot is whether to use Poker or [the Mobile Spawner](MS). When it comes down to it, there aren't many things Poker has that the Mobile Spawner doesn't. They function the same, so if you used one then switching to the other wouldn't be as hard. There is one thing the Mobile Spawner has over Poker, and that's the *freezer*. 

The freezer is like Poker's regenerator, except it runs entirely on your Switch. This means that you don't have to keep the app open for the items to respawn. The Mobile Spawner also  runs on iOS and Mac devices, which Poker can't. So if you use either then that's a plus.

Other than that, it just comes down to which UI you like better. Most use them interchangeably, the MS for freezing and Poker for everything else.

## Downloading

To use Poker, you'll first need sys-botbase to connect your Switch to your PC.

1. Go to [https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase/releases](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase/releases) and download the latest version.
2. Extract the `sys-botbase.zip` and place it on your SD card.
   - You want to have a `430000000000000B` folder inside the `atmosphere/contents/` folder. If you don't, then it's not installed correctly.
3. When it's installed, boot into CFW, and then open Animal Crossing.
   - You'll know it's installed correctly, because your home button will glow blue.

Now that sys-botbase is installed, you can download and use Poker.

1. Go to [https://github.com/MyShiLingStar/ACNHPoker/releases](https://github.com/MyShiLingStar/ACNHPoker/releases) and download the latest version.
2. Extract the `ReleaseXX.zip`, and open the `ACNHPoker.exe`
3. Change the default IP address to your own.
   - You can find your IP address in the Internet Settings (`System Settings > Internet > IP Address`)
   - Every IP address is different, what I have is not going to be the same for you.
4. Press connect, and Poker is ready to be used.
