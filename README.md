# Yo waddup!
[**ac-modding.com**](https://ac-modding.com/) is a website for anything that has to do with, you guessed it, Animal Crossing modding. 

This was primarily made, since I felt a lack of a central source of information made it too intimidating to get into, when in reality it isn't that hard.

It was also made to help out the googlers, typing in things like "how to make a treasure island", "how to install animal crossing mods", and things of that sort.
