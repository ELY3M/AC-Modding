This website is using Google Analytics (GA) now. You can check out their privacy policies [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) and [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245), and opt out using [this](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

GA collects stuff like the date you visited, your (vague) location from your IP, and how you got to the website (google search, discord, etc.)  
The only thing I really care about is how you got here. I don't care where you live.  
I will not sell, steal, lease, transmit, pass on or almost anything else with GA. 
I will not use your data to advertise to you. I don't want your money. I have [a tomato farm](https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1405205780329078793).  
I won't keep a copy of any data, but GA cache's your visit for 26 months.
