## Save Editing

[There are multiple save editors for New Leaf:](ACNL/SE) ACSE, ACNLSE, and LeafEdit. ACSE (Animal Crossing Save Editor) is a save editor for every main AC game, except for [New Horizons](ACNH). ACNLSE (Animal Crossing: New Leaf Save Editor) is an online save editor. LeafEdit *was* <sup><sup>(has been discontinued)</sup></sup> a save editor for Wild World *and* New Leaf.

## Streaming

[Learn how to stream Animal Crossing from your 3ds, **without** a capture card.](ACNL/streaming) There are currently only two ways to output video directly from a standard 3DS console, and both require a PC for viewing. There are no direct HDMI modifications, nor are there any plug-and-play solutions; everything outside of pointing a camera at your system requires either a hardware or software modification.

## Mods

[Learn how to **get** or **make** mods, and then install them to your game.](ACNL/mods) 
## Emulating

[Learn how to play Animal Crossing on your PC with Citra.](ACNL/emulation) Emulating requires pretty decent hardware for the game to run at full speed, no lag. So if your Macbook Air from 2012 can't open Chrome without the thing dying, then you probably shouldn't even try. Emulating is also good if you want to use mods but don't want to put them on your 3ds or just want to test it out quickly without having to put it on there. It is a bit hard to set it up, but it's useful for what I've previously mentioned.
