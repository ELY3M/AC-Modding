[A good tl;dr of what will/will not get you banned can be found here](https://nx.eiphax.tech/ban). 

# Will I be banned for using NHSE/Poker/Game Mods?

As far as I know, there have never been any console bans from editing your save, but there are "temporary" and "save" bans. On the ban guide, I'd say the console ban from modding/save editing excludes New Horizons, because that mostly means competitive games like Smash or mk8.

**Temp bans** are for using mods that can't be used in online play, or making illegal save edits. The 360 camera mod is one that can be used in online play, but a mod that changes the spawn rate of every critter in the game might not. That prevents you from accessing online modes in New Horizons until you remove the mod. When you do remove it, you'll be able to use online services again. Making an illegal edit can be undone, and will let you go online again. 
And by making illegal save edits, the only "illegal" edit I've found was changing the personality of a villager to something it isn't.

**Save bans** prevent a save from ever going online again. Presumably, each created island has its own ID, which will never be the same as another. When you do something that elicits a save ban, then it prevents any island with that specific ID from going online. It's still nothing to worry about, as you can simply make a new save and play on that. The only thing I've seen cause a save ban is sharing a direct JKSV dump to another person, and both of those islands being online. 

Basically, there's nothing to worry about. <br> In the case of a "temp" ban, you simply have to remove the mod or illegal edit. <br> In the case of a "save" ban, you just have to make a new island. All of your progress can be carried over by dumping the map, player flags, etc. onto the new island.

# Why shouldn't I use emuNAND?

**emuNAND** (aka emuMMC) is, essentially, a second switch. It is stored completely on your SD card, on a separate partition, and not the internal storage. Because of this, whatever you do on your emuNAND will not be on your sysNAND, and whatever you do on your sysNAND will not be on your emuNAND.

For the most part, emuNAND is used to do things that could get you banned, but to always keep it OFFLINE, then only go online with sysNAND. So since all of the bannable actions were done on the emuNAND, keeping it forever offline let’s you get away with being banned. Another way it could be used is to prevent a brick, something that could render your device completely useless. Do note however, your sysNAND and emuNAND do share a couple of things, such as the system/cartridge fuses, as well as your ban state. So if you DO get banned, there's nothing you can do.

This guide does not go over setting up emuNAND. It is not needed, nor is it recommended, unless you want to pirate, or do other bannable actions. In the case of Animal Crossing, no matter what mods you have or what you do in the game, you can't be banned. The most that will happen is the game prevents you from going online, until you remove the downloaded mods. And when they're removed, it's like nothing happened. You shouldn’t go online with emuNAND and then go online with sysNAND, as mismatched logs will be the reason you get banned. Plus, the entire point of emuNAND is to keep it offline.

To not worry about this, simply go online with sysCFW. Not only does it give you the benefits of Custom Firmware, but because sysCFW is on your sysNAND (hence the name) you don't have to worry about mismatched logs, as the logs will be the same on both.
