# Yo waddup!
[**ac-modding.com**](https://ac-modding.com/) is a website for anything that has to do with, you guessed it, Animal Crossing modding. 

This website is to help out the googlers, typing in things like "how to make a treasure island", "how to install animal crossing mods", and things of that sort. 

You can follow my tutorial on [setting up Switch CFW](switch-guide), as you will need it to mod the game. 

## To go to the title of Animal Crossing that you want to mod, click the title of the game.
