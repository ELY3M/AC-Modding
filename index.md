# Yo waddup!
[**ac-modding.com**](https://ac-modding.com/) is a website for anything that has to do with, you guessed it, Animal Crossing modding. 

Despite me having a *moddable* switch, I didn't know what could be done with it until I saw treasure islands. These islands have most, if not all items in the game for people to take. I ran ACNH giveaways, and obviously getting items legit (even when trading) takes a long time. So I learned how to mod my switch, save edit with NHSE, and make a treasure island to help out people just starting with the game, or even people who've been playing for months and don't have the last piece to their puzzle. So now, with this newfound information, I can help out the people trying to do the same thing. 

This will also help out the googlers, typing in things like "how to make a treasure island", "how to install animal crossing mods", and things of that sort. Both of the things just mentioned will be on the site later.

# Anything I should know already?
**Be aware that, no matter what, EVERY time you modify the console, there's a chance of an UNRECOVERABLE BRICK.** These are very, *very* rare, but still a possibility, so always make sure that you follow any directions EXACTLY.

You can follow my tutorial on [setting up Switch CFW](switch-guide), as you will need it to mod the game.

# **This site is not finished yet. I want to add everything in at once, but I will most likely go through one game at a time, starting from New Horizons, down to the OG title.**
