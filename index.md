# Yo waddup!
[**ac-modding.com**](https://ac-modding.com/) is a website for anything that has to do with, you guessed it, Animal Crossing modding. 

You can follow my tutorial on [setting up Switch CFW](switch-guide), as you will need it to mod the game. If you already have a modded switch, [follow my modding series](ACNH/mods) to mod the game.

Some guides aren't specific to Animal Crossing, like the [SysDVR](SysDVR) guide, which can be used stream your Switch to PC without a capture card. You can [click here to look at a list of all available pages](219).
