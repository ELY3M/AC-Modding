# Yo waddup!
[**ac-modding.com**](https://ac-modding.com/) is a website for anything that has to do with, you guessed it, Animal Crossing modding. 

This was primarily made, since I felt a lack of a central source for information made it too intimidating to get into, when in reality it isn't that hard.

It was also made to help out the googlers, typing in things like "how to make a treasure island", "how to install animal crossing mods", and things of that sort. Both of the things just mentioned will be on the site later.

# Anything I should know before doing stuff?
**Be aware that, no matter what, EVERY time you modify the console, there's a chance of an UNRECOVERABLE BRICK.** These are very, *very* rare, but still a possibility, so always make sure that you follow any directions EXACTLY.

If you have any questions, I've tried my best to answer them all **[over here, on the help page](/help)**. I try to keep it organized, and showing pictures if needed. There's a Table of Contents, so you dont spend 10 hours looking for something.


## To go to the title of Animal Crossing that you want to mod, click the title of the game.
[Animal Crossing: New Horizons](/ACNH)


# **This site is not finished yet. I want to add everything in at once, but I will most likely go through one game at a time, starting from New Horizons, down to the OG title.**

# **So far, I only have completed categories for ACNH. New Leaf is next**
