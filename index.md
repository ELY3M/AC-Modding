# Yo waddup!
[**ac-modding.com**](https://ac-modding.com/) is a website for anything that has to do with, you guessed it, Animal Crossing modding. 

This was primarily made, since I felt a lack of a central source for information made it too intimidating to get into, when in reality it isn't that hard.

It was also made to help out the googlers, typing in things like "how to make a treasure island", "how to install animal crossing mods", and things of that sort. Both of the things just mentioned will be on the site later.

Hopefully, clicking [this](/page/ACNH/NHSE) will take you to the NHSE page. Nothing's on it, but need to make sure that this works.

# **This site is not finished yet. I want to add everything in at once, but I will most likely go through one game at a time, starting from New Horizons, down to the OG title.**
