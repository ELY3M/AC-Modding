# Yo waddup!
[**ac-modding.com**](https://ac-modding.com/) is a website for anything that has to do with, you guessed it, Animal Crossing modding. 

This website is to help out the googlers, typing in things like "how to make a treasure island", "how to install animal crossing mods", and things of that sort. 

You can follow my tutorial on [setting up Switch CFW](switch-guide), as you will need it to mod the game. 

If you already have a modded switch, [follow my modding series](ACNH/mods) to mod the game.

Some guides aren't specific to Animal Crossing, like the [FTPD](FTPD) guide, which can be used to transfer files from your SD to your PC. You can [click here to look at a list of all available pages](219).
